## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd /home/claude/procurement_hub
pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```

2. **Generate Datasets** (Already done)
```bash
python generate_datasets.py
```

3. **Run the Application**
```bash
python app.py
```

4. **Access the Application**
Open browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`

## 📊 Dataset Details

### Suppliers Dataset (500 entries)
- **Industries**: Electronics, Automotive, Construction, Textiles, Pharmaceuticals, Food & Beverage, Chemicals, Machinery, Plastics, Metal Works
- **Countries**: 12 countries with varying risk profiles
- **Attributes**: 
  - Basic info (name, location, contact)
  - Risk factors (political, trade, natural disasters)
  - Financial metrics (credit rating, revenue growth, profit margin)
  - Performance metrics (on-time delivery, quality score, response time)
  - Business history (years, employees, certifications)

### Purchase Orders Dataset (4500 entries)
- **Time Range**: 2 years of historical data
- **Attributes**:
  - Order details (PO number, dates, status)
  - Items (description, quantity, pricing)
  - Supplier information
  - Delivery tracking (expected vs actual)
  - Financial details (subtotal, tax, total)

## 🧮 Recommendation Algorithm

The system uses a weighted scoring model:

```python
Match Score = (
    Risk Score × 0.25 +
    Financial Score × 0.20 +
    Performance Score × 0.35 +
    History Score × 0.20
)
```

### Sub-scores:
1. **Risk Score (0-100)**:
   - Political risk: 40%
   - Trade risk: 35%
   - Natural disaster risk: 25%

2. **Financial Score (0-100)**:
   - Credit rating: 50%
   - Revenue growth: 25%
   - Profit margin: 25%

3. **Performance Score (0-100)**:
   - On-time delivery: 50%
   - Quality score: 30%
   - Response time: 20%

4. **History Score (0-100)**:
   - Total orders: 40%
   - Business value: 30%
   - Years in business: 30%
